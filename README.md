In my summer project, 2024, I investigated the evolution of cross-resistance, a novel trait, under fluctuating combinations of antibiotic stresses in E. coli. 
The stresses I looked at were increase in concentration of antibiotics and switching between Streptomycin and Ceftazidime, antibiotics with non-overlapping modes of action. 
I evolved wild-type E. coli populations for ~ 54 generations on different combinations of the above factors. I then plotted their growth on Nalidixic Acid and curve-fit the data to the logistic growth curve equation as a first step, subsequently comparing growth rates and carrying capacities as proxies for fitness. 
We saw a significant difference for growth rates between the unevolved and evolved populations, but not in carrying capacities. I am yet to investigate more suitable models for the growth of bacteria on antibiotics.


Present in this folder (as of 31st January, 2025) are the codes for both plotting and extracting curve-fit parameters for the growth curves of the E. coli populations.
Two codes were created, one for the control populations, and another for the evolved populations.
These codes were created partially with suggestions from ChatGPT 3.0.
